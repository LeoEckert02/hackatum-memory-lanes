### 💡 Inspiration  
Memory Lanes was inspired by our love for walking, storytelling, and connecting generations. Thinking of our grandmothers' rich yet often unheard stories, we created a platform to preserve memories and foster community through the simple act of listening and sharing.  

### 🎯 What It Does  
Memory Lanes connects users to personal stories told by elders, tied to specific locations. 🗺️ Using the app, you can explore a city map marked with story points, scan QR codes at these locations, and access fascinating stories deeply rooted in the history and transformation of the place. Stories are available as audio 🎙️, accompanied by subtitles in German or English. Users can also request meetups with storytellers, fostering meaningful intergenerational connections.  

### ⚙️ How We Built It  
- **Frontend:** React with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui for clean and streamlined styling.  
- **Location Features:** Google Maps API to display and interact with story points on a map.  
- **Backend:** Pocketbase for an out-of-the-box database and API solution.  
- **Audio Tools:** OpenAI’s Whisper model for transcription and translation.
